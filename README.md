# MarkDown-Table-Of-Contents-Generator

This application is made to automate the creation of table of contents for markdown files. It only uses the title headers and they table indicates the title level and the line number it is in.

## TODO
- Make the headers reference to the titles
- Put the number of line each header is on and index on the left
- Put a dotted line between the header and the line number
- Allow user to add a brief description to a header in the table of contents
- Ask if TOC should be overwritten if it already exists
